Bubble graph using Eventbrite API data

To run the code just put the 3 files in the same directory and open the html file in your browser.

I removed my personal token for the Eventbrite API calls so to try it yourself you must log into Eventbrite's website and go to http://www.eventbrite.com/myaccount/apps/ to get your own OAuth token.
